      <h2>Cycling</h2>
      <p>Cawood is a bike-friendly village and there are plenty of places to park and lock bikes. Cawoodstock venues
        will endeavour to help with safe places to park bikes if you ask them nicely :-)</p>

      <h2>Walking</h2>
      <p>Walking: We hope lots of Cawood residents will want to attend, so of course if you live within the village
        please walk to the venues as this minimises traffic and parking issues, and it's good for you!</p>
      <p>Cawood is also fairly easily walkable from our nearest neighbour villages Ryther, Kelfield, Biggin, Wistow and
        Stillingfleet - the walk takes under an hour and if you check the maps you can often find quiet, low car-traffic
        routes such as <a
