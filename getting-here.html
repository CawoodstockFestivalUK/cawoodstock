      <h3>Cycling</h3>
      <p>Cawood is a bike-friendly village and there are plenty of places to park and lock bikes. Cawoodstock venues will endeavour to help with safe places to park bikes if you ask them nicely :-)</p>

      <h3>Walking</h3>
      <p>Walking: We hope lots of Cawood residents will want to attend, so of course if you live within the village please walk to the venues as this minimises traffic and parking issues, and it's good for you!</p>
      <p>Cawood is also fairly easily walkable from our nearest neighbour villages Ryther, Kelfield, Biggin, Wistow and Stillingfleet - the walk takes around an hour and if you check the maps you can often find quiet, low car-traffic routes such as <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/53.8139746,-1.1006264/53.8330326,-1.1296272/@53.8259577,-1.1159757,14z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-1.1067464!2d53.830244!3s0x48793b8dedd735ad:0xc0e82ed0b20f0d87!1m0!3e2?hl=en-GB">this 'back roads' route from Wistow to Cawood</a></p>

      <h3>Taxi</h3>
      <p>There are many local taxi companies - <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/taxi/@53.8145403,-1.1703318,13z?hl=en-GB">here's a Google Maps search</a> which will show you all the taxi companies in the area so you can choose your nearest or preferred company</p>

      <h3>Car</h3>
      <p>PARKING IS EXTREMELY LIMITED IN CAWOOD! - Cawood is a small, compact village and parking within the village is extremely limited. We have secured a small amount of additional parking for Cawoodstock, but please still try to minimise cars within the village by car-sharing or using taxis / lifts / drop-offs rather than parking in the village. <strong>We cannot guarantee a parking space for everyone, and cars parked illegally or causing an obstruction will not be tolerated</strong>.</p>
