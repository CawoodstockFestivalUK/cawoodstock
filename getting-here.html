      <h2>Cycling</h2>
      <p>Cawood is a bike-friendly village and there are plenty of places to park and lock bikes. Cawoodstock venues will endeavour to help with safe places to park bikes if you ask them nicely :-)</p>

      <h2>Walking</h2>
      <p>Walking: We hope lots of Cawood residents will want to attend, so of course if you live within the village please walk to the venues as this minimises traffic and parking issues, and it's good for you!</p>
      <p>Cawood is also fairly easily walkable from our nearest neighbour villages Ryther, Kelfield, Biggin, Wistow and Stillingfleet - the walk takes around an hour and if you check the maps you can often find quiet, low car-traffic routes such as <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/53.8139746,-1.1006264/53.8330326,-1.1296272/@53.8259577,-1.1159757,14z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-1.1067464!2d53.830244!3s0x48793b8dedd735ad:0xc0e82ed0b20f0d87!1m0!3e2?hl=en-GB">this 'back roads' route from Wistow to Cawood</a></p>

      1) We have now secured some overflow parking just off Rythergate in a farm field (<i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/53%C2%B050'06.2%22N+1%C2%B008'00.4%22W/@53.8350556,-1.1345503,348m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d53.835054!4d-1.1334549">location on Google map</a>) Massive thanks and applause to Georgina and Graham Liddle for letting us use this field once again <br/>
      2) The car parks at Cawood Primary School will also be open over the weekend.
