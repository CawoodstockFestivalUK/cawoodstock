      Buses: The 42 and 42S services run through Cawood regularly (link to timetable)

      Cycling: Cawood is a bike-friendly village and there are plenty of places to park and lock bikes. Cawoodstock venues will endeavour to help with safe places to park bikes.

      Walking: We hope lots of Cawood residents will want to attend, so of course if you live within the village please walk to the venues as this minimises traffic and parking issues, and it's good for you!

      A quiet, low car-traffic route from Selby to Cawood is here, this route takes around XX minutes to walk

      Taxi: local taxi companies numbers

      Shuttle Buses

      Car: Cawood is a small, compact village and parking within the village is extremely limited. We have secured a small amount of additional parking for Cawoodstock, but please still try to minimise cars within the village by car-sharing or using taxis/lifts/drop-offs rather than parking in the village. We cannot guarantee a parking space for everyone, and cars parked illegally or causing an obstruction will not be tolerated.
