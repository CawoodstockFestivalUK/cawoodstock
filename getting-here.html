      Buses: The 42 and 42S services run through Cawood regularly (link to timetable)

      Cycling: Cawood is a bike-friendly village and there are plenty of places to park and lock bikes. Cawoodstock venues will endeavour to help with safe places to park bikes.

      Walking: A low traffic route from Selby to Cawood

      Taxi: local taxi companies numbers

      Shuttle Buses

      Car: Cawood is a small, compact village and parking within the village is extremely limited. We have secured a small amount of additional parking for Cawoodstock, but please still try to minimise cars within the village by car-sharing or using taxis/lifts/drop-offs rather than parking in the village. We cannot guarantee a parking space for everyone, and cars parked illegally will not be tolerated. 

      <p>All forms of music, cultural activities and performing arts are encouraged - whether it be a rock band or a poetry reading. Dance, film, literature, singing, storytelling... anything that comes under the heading of music, culture, or performing arts is fair game! We're particularly keen to encourage activities that engage young people in the Arts and facilitate their development as musicians and performers.</p>

      <p>Cawoodstock is organised and run by the people of Cawood for the people of our village and the surrounding area. We are unfunded and everyone is a volunteer. It's important that the festival has a home-grown, grass-roots feel, and that the people of Cawood have the freedom to make the festival whatever they want it to be.</p>

      <p>Participating venues organise their own musical acts, cultural events, and other activities, directly with the artists. The small Cawoodstock team co-ordinates these into a listing here on the website.</p>
