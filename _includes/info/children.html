Cawoodstock is a family festival and in general children are welcome throughout Cawoodstock. Activities particularly suitable for children are marked <i class="fas fa-child" title="Kids' Activity"></i>
</br></br>
However, events in the later evening and those taking place in pubs may not be quite as suitable for children, and the venues may have their own family policies, which you must abide by.
