  name: "Kids Jam Session"
  description: |
    In what has become something of a Cawoodstock tradition once again we have the Kids Jamming Session, this is an opportunity to get younger players involved in an open jam (not an open mic!) where everyone is welcome to join in and sing and play along with everyone else's songs. It's designed to be non-intimidating and welcoming to all abilities, all instruments, and all kinds of music. A few adults will be around to help get things going, and some of our experienced Cawood young musicians will be there to welcome you all. Come to participate or to listen!
