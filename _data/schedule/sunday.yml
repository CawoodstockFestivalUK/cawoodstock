  name: "Young Musicians's Open Jam Session"
  description: |
    A fun, simple singalong and jam session just for young musicians to get them into jamming! Sing your favourite songs & play instruments with your friends and a live acoustic band! Nobody's going to be put on the spot to play solo, it's a joint effort - a jam, not an open mic. Plenty of musical parents will be around to help out and get everyone involved.
