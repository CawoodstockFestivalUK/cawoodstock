    No it's *not* an Open Mic - it's a jam session! Get a drink and bring an instrument. Expect to join in with everyone else's stuff. No rules except don't drown everyone else out with your Mesa/Boogie stack ;-) Aim acoustic... we have instruments at the Jolly including piano, cajon, guitar and uke.
